# TicTacToe

This project was built using guidelines and teachings from The Odin Project

This is a TicTacToe game built using Ruby and OOP principles. This game is played entirely on the commmand line with an updated board after each turn for easy visual understanding. This game is meant to be played by two human players. There are two outcomes, either a winner or a draw, with the ability to play over and over.

This was my first project using Ruby and OOP. I enjoy the simplicity of the ruby language and find the code easy to read and understand. This was also my first time using rubocop which at first flagged everything I did. Since I am new to the language,  I ended up appreciating the micro-managing aspect of it as a learning tool.
